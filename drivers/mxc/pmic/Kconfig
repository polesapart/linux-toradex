config MXC_SPI_PMIC_CORE
	tristate "PMIC Protocol support (SPI interface)"
	depends on ARCH_MXC && SPI_MXC
	default n
	---help---
	This is the PMIC core/protocol driver for the Freescale MXC application.
	SPI should be providing the interface between the PMIC and the MCU.
	You must select the SPI driver support to enable this option.

config MXC_I2C_MCU_PMIC_CORE
        tristate "MCU PMIC Protocol support (I2C interface)"
        depends on ARCH_MXC
        default n
        ---help---
        This is the PMIC core/protocol driver for the MX35 3DS MCU PMIC

config MXC_PMIC
	boolean
	default (MXC_SPI_PMIC_CORE || MXC_I2C_MCU_PMIC_CORE)

config MXC_PMIC_CHARDEV
	tristate "MXC PMIC device interface"
	depends on MXC_PMIC
	help
	  Say Y here to use "pmic" device files, found in the /dev directory
	  on the system.  They make it possible to have user-space programs
	  use or controll PMIC. Mainly its useful for notifying PMIC events
	  to user-space programs.

	This is the MXC MC13783(PMIC) client drivers support. It include
	ADC, Audio, Battery, Connectivity, Light, Power and RTC.

config MXC_PMIC_FIXARB
        bool "Use Arbitration Bit Workaround"
        depends on MXC_PMIC_SC55112
        default n
        ---help---
            Enable this option to include the code that will automatically
            toggle the sc55112 arbitration bits to allow register write
            access to the secondary processor. Note that this also requires
            a hardware modification to the RF Deck that connects the Sphinx
            card (with the sc55112 PMIC) to the MXC91131 EVB.

config MXC_PMIC_MC9SDZ60
        tristate "MC9sDZ60 Client Drivers"

        depends on !ARCH_MXC91131
        default n
        ---help---
        This is the MXC MC9sDZ60(MCU) PMIC client drivers support.
